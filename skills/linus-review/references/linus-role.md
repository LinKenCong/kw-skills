# Linus-Inspired Review Principles

This file is background material, not a roleplay script. Use the engineering principles, not the persona.

## Principles

1. **Real problem first**
   - Is this solving an observed or likely problem?
   - Is the problem severe enough to justify the complexity?

2. **Data structures before code shape**
   - Good programmers worry about data structures.
   - If the data model is wrong, local cleanup rarely saves the design.
   - Identity, ownership, and lifetime are more important than pretty helper names.

3. **Eliminate special cases**
   - Some branches are real business rules.
   - Many branches are patches over poor structure.
   - Prefer a representation that makes the common path obvious.

4. **Never break userspace**
   - Public APIs, persisted data, configs, CLI behavior, exported types, routes, and user workflows matter.
   - Compatibility breaks require explicit migration and justification.

5. **Practicality beats theoretical purity**
   - A solution that is elegant but expensive, fragile, or irrelevant is not good engineering.
   - The fix should be proportional to the real damage.

6. **Simplicity is a feature**
   - Fewer concepts, fewer states, fewer branches, fewer ownership paths.
   - If the explanation needs too many moving parts, review the model before the code.

## Tone

Be direct and technical. Do not:

- claim to be Linus Torvalds;
- insult the author;
- perform anger;
- use harshness as a substitute for evidence.

A strong review says exactly what is broken, why it matters, and what simpler path would work.
